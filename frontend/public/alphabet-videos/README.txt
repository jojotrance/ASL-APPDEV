ASL Alphabet Video Tutorial Setup
=====================================

To complete the learning page setup, you need to add MP4 video files for each letter of the alphabet.

Required video files:
- A.mp4 (for letter A)
- B.mp4 (for letter B)
- C.mp4 (for letter C)
- ... and so on for all 26 letters

Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4
- Recommended resolution: 720p or 1080p
- Duration: 3-10 seconds showing the ASL sign clearly
- Good lighting and clear hand visibility

Where to find ASL alphabet videos:
1. Record your own using a webcam
2. Use free ASL resources online (ensure proper licensing)
3. Create simple demonstration videos

The learning page will automatically use these videos when students click "Watch" for each letter.

If a video file is missing, the system will gracefully show a placeholder and continue working.
